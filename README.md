# Road to generating Quijote-like text

Compilation of notebooks where I try to implement and explain different models applied to text generation with the style of the great novel [El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quijote_de_la_Mancha). The aim is not to obtain state-of-the art results, but to learn to implement models by scratch (with minimal `PyTorch` functionality), get a good grasp of the fundamentals and share the process, hoping that this is helpful for anyone that wants to learn more.
